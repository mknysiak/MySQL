# Introduction
I'm thrilled to share my latest SQL project analyzing Major League Baseball (MLB) data ‚öæ. The project explores four key areas: school and player demographics, salary trends, player career longevity, and physical characteristics. I chose this dataset to move beyond basic joins and practice more advanced SQL techniques, such as window functions and complex subqueries, to answer questions like:

1. How has the average player's height and weight changed over the decades?
2. Which teams consistently rank in the top 20% for player salaries?
3. What is the career length of different players, and how many played for over a decade with the same team?

This project was a fantastic way to apply my skills to a rich, real-world dataset and uncover some truly interesting insights. Looking forward to sharing my findings!

# Tools which were used
Below are listed tools which were used to find out the answers on above questions:

- ‚öôÔ∏è**MySQL Server/Workbench:** This was my chosen environment for storing and managing the database, providing a robust platform for efficient data manipulation.
- üíª**Visual Studio Code:** Used this IDE to write and manage my SQL scripts, seamlessly integrating with Git for version control.
- üåê**Git & GitHub:** These platforms were essential for managing project versions, documenting my process, and making the entire codebase publicly accessible for transparency and future reference.

# Analysis

üè´First of all, I wanted to find out how many schools produced MLB players in each decade. As table consisted of PlayerID and SchoolID was used many times, decided to create a Temporary Table.

```sql
CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE grads as
with g as(
SELECT playerid, schoolid, yearid,
	ROW_NUMBER() over (partition by playerid, schoolid order by yearid desc) years
from schools
order by playerid asc
)
select * from g where years = 1;
select * from grads;

with number as(
select count(schoolid) no_of_schools, floor((yearid-1)/10)*10 decade
from grads
group by floor((yearid-1)/10)*10
order by floor((yearid-1)/10)*10
)
select no_of_schools, concat(decade+1,'-',decade+10) decade
from number;
```
As we can see above, the number of schools producing MLB players has generally increased over the decades, with a peak in the 1991-2000 decade. However, there is a noticeable drop in the 2011-2020 decade, because the data for this decade is incomplete.

| Number of Schools | Decade    |
| ------------- | --------- |
| 2             | 1861-1870 |
| 17            | 1871-1880 |
| 49            | 1881-1890 |
| 172           | 1891-1900 |
| 335           | 1901-1910 |
| 389           | 1911-1920 |
| 399           | 1921-1930 |
| 302           | 1931-1940 |
| 249           | 1941-1950 |
| 294           | 1951-1960 |
| 591           | 1961-1970 |
| 984           | 1971-1980 |
| 1325          | 1981-1990 |
| 1333          | 1991-2000 |
| 1076          | 2001-2010 |
| 33            | 2011-2020 |

The second question I decided to answer was:
*What are the top 5 schools that produced the most MLB players for the entire dataset?*.

```sql
select name_full school_name, count(playerid) no_of_players
from grads g
inner join school_details sd on g.schoolID = sd.schoolID
group by name_full
order by count(playerid) desc
limit 5;
```

The University of Texas at Austin leads with 107 players, closely followed by the University of Southern California with 105 players. Arizona State University also has a significant contribution with 101 players. These institutions have been particularly successful in nurturing talent that progresses to Major League Baseball.
